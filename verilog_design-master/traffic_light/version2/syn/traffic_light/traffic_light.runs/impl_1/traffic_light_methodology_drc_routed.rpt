2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/fb_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/t_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/t_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/t_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/t_reg[3]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin u_timer/t_reg[4]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -8.730 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]_replica_3/C (clocked by clk_125M) and HL[2] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.193 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]_replica_1/C (clocked by clk_125M) and HL[1] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.226 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]_replica/C (clocked by clk_125M) and FL[2] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.231 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[1]_replica_2/C (clocked by clk_125M) and FL[0] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.264 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]_replica/C (clocked by clk_125M) and FL[1] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -9.284 ns between u_FSM/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]_replica/C (clocked by clk_125M) and HL[0] (clocked by clk_125M). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
